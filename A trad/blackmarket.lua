bm_msk_wmp_03_desc = "TranslationHere",--This pilotka was found on a corpse near Lake Müritz in Germany. It was attached with a string around the poor, dead soldier's head.

But he picked the wrong vicious mongrel to mess with. The dog ended up biting everyone in the crew before they managed to escape the beast.

The CCTV footage shows that Paycheck Dallas accidentally broke the biggest vase while storming in. That made him apologize to the owner, grab all small changes from register and run for the door.  Probably blushing like a tomato behind that smiling neon mask.
