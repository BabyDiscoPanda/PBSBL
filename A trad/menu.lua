menu_feature_crimenet_welcome_desc_PS3 = "TranslationHere",--From: Bain [bain@///REDACTED///]$NL;To: $player;$NL;Date: 2013-08-13 00:02 (GMT+1)$NL;Subject: Welcome to crime.net$NL;$NL;Greetings, $player;, and welcome to Crime.net.$NL;$NL;If you are reading this, it means you have been cleared for access to the hub of our organization. Congratulations; You have taken your first step into a larger world.$NL;$NL;Let's have a look at the basic functions of Crime.net. Don't worry if it seems complex at first, everything is more or less self-explanatory.$NL;$NL;» CRIME.NET$NL;This is where you find new jobs, hook up with other crews, learn more about your contacts, and, occasionally, gamble away some of your hard earned off-shore funds.$NL;$NL;» HOSTING A CONTRACT$NL;Jobs with a timer are for you to host. Once the timer reaches zero, that contract will disappear and Crime.net will spawn another. A note on hosting: you are in charge of the contract, and you are responsible for your crew. $NL;$NL;If you drop out, the whole crew loses. Try and keep everyone alive, and make sure everyone makes it to the PAYDAY.$NL;$NL;» JOINING A CONTRACT$NL;Jobs that someone else is hosting have an icon with four men on them instead of a timer. The host's name is diplayed in blue, or green if it's a friend. You can join the crew as long as there is at least one empty slot.$NL;$NL;» DIFFICULTY$NL;Difficulty is rated from zero to four skulls. The more skulls, the harder it is. If this is your first time, pick a no-skull job. Trust me. Four skulls is what we call a Death Wish, and you shouldn't even attempt this until you are at least level 50.$NL;$NL;» REWARDS$NL;Successfully completing a contract will earn you cash and experience. Roll over a contract marker to see what the base payout is. Your final payday may be a lot bigger though; there are bonuses for risk, and you may be able to score additional funds during the heist. Remember: anything you can get your hands on is profit.$NL;$NL;The money and EXP is awarded after each day of the contract is completed. $NL;$NL;Once you've completed the entire contract, you'll also get what we call a PAYDAY: you get to draw a card to unlock a random item. This is how you score rare masks, weapon mods and other useful things. $NL;$NL;» CONTRACT LENGTH$NL;Jobs have different length. Start out doing a few 1 one day jobs before you move on to the longer heists. The EXP reward scales to your level, so there's no reason to kill yourself on a job that's too big for you at the start.$NL;$NL;$NL;THE SLIGHTLY MORE COMPLEX STUFF$NL;$NL;» PRO JOBS$NL;Some jobs have a red outline and 'PRO' label. Pro jobs give a bigger pay and more XP than normal jobs. If you fail however, you don't get to retry. Bear this in mind if you are attempting a multi-day heist.$NL;$NL;» STEALTH$NL;If you see a small ghost icon next to a contract marker, that means it's possible to complete the job without raising the alarm. Doing a job in stealth will net you an EXP bonus, which applies to any contract you take on immediately afterwards. A word of advice: If you're new to this, don't worry about stealth just yet. It  takes a tight crew with some serious skills to pull off a clean stealth job.$NL;$NL;» THE BOOST SYSTEM$NL;If you do the same job repeatedly, the EXP return will start to drop on that particular contract, and it will be boosted on others. The trick of maximising your EXP is to do a wide range of jobs. Boost is displayed with minus signs and a red glow for reduced EXP; and plus signs and an orange glow for increased EXP.$NL;$NL;» CONTRACT BROKER$NL;Once you get some cash together and start to level up, you can visit the contract broker and pick which jobs you want to do. Again, if this is your first time, just run with the offered contracts for now.$NL;$NL;TL;DR:$NL;Use Crime.net to find jobs and make money for that epic PAYDAY.$NL;$NL;This is all you need to know for now. Once you've climbed a few rungs on the criminal ladder, I'll drop you another note and talk you through some of the more complex stuff. Good luck.$NL;$NL;- Bain$NL;

As part of the Crimefest celebrations, let me introduce you to the Perk Decks! The perk decks is a new feature that replaces the old tier bonus system in the skill trees, and adds a new way of fast and free tweaking of your build. A perk deck symbolizes a group of active and passive bonuses that are given to your character. You can pick and choose any of the perk decks and unlock them independently of your level. Only one can be active at any given time. Perk Points are converted from gained EXP points, and you'll keep gaining EXP even after hitting the level cap.$NL;$NL;To gain a perk, simply click and hold the + icon in the perk deck that you want to level up.

Congratulations; You have taken your first step into a larger world.$NL;$NL;Let's have a look at the basic functions of Crime.net. Don't worry if it seems complex at first, everything is more or less self-explanatory.$NL;$NL;» CRIME.NET$NL;This is where you find new jobs, hook up with other crews, learn more about your contacts, and, occasionally, gamble away some of your hard earned off-shore funds.$NL;$NL;» HOSTING A CONTRACT$NL;Jobs with a timer are for you to host. Once the timer reaches zero, that contract will disappear and Crime.net will spawn another. A note on hosting: you are in charge of the contract, and you are responsible for your crew. $NL;$NL;If you drop out, the whole crew loses. Try and keep everyone alive, and make sure everyone makes it to the PAYDAY.$NL;$NL;» JOINING A CONTRACT$NL;Jobs that someone else is hosting have an icon with four men on them instead of a timer. The host's name is diplayed in blue, or green if it's a friend. You can join the crew as long as there is at least one empty slot.$NL;$NL;» DIFFICULTY$NL;Difficulty is rated from zero to four skulls. The more skulls, the harder it is. If this is your first time, pick a no-skull job. Trust me. Four skulls is what we call a Death Wish, and you shouldn't even attempt this until you are at least level 50.$NL;$NL;» REWARDS$NL;Successfully completing a contract will earn you cash and experience. Roll over a contract marker to see what the base payout is. Your final payday may be a lot bigger though; there are bonuses for risk, and you may be able to score additional funds during the heist. Remember: anything you can get your hands on is profit.$NL;$NL;The money and EXP is awarded after each day of the contract is completed. $NL;$NL;Once you've completed the entire contract, you'll also get what we call a PAYDAY: you get to draw a card to unlock a random item. This is how you score rare masks, weapon mods and other useful things. $NL;$NL;» CONTRACT LENGTH$NL;Jobs have different length. Start out doing a few 1 one day jobs before you move on to the longer heists. The EXP reward scales to your level, so there's no reason to kill yourself on a job that's too big for you at the start.$NL;$NL;$NL;THE SLIGHTLY MORE COMPLEX STUFF$NL;$NL;» PRO JOBS$NL;Some jobs have a red outline and 'PRO' label. Pro jobs give a bigger pay and more XP than normal jobs. If you fail however, you don't get to retry. Bear this in mind if you are attempting a multi-day heist.$NL;$NL;» STEALTH$NL;If you see a small ghost icon next to a contract marker, that means it's possible to complete the job without raising the alarm. Doing a job in stealth will net you an EXP bonus, which applies to any contract you take on immediately afterwards. A word of advice: If you're new to this, don't worry about stealth just yet. It  takes a tight crew with some serious skills to pull off a clean stealth job.$NL;$NL;» THE BOOST SYSTEM$NL;If you do the same job repeatedly, the EXP return will start to drop on that particular contract, and it will be boosted on others. The trick of maximising your EXP is to do a wide range of jobs. Boost is displayed with minus signs and a red glow for reduced EXP; and plus signs and an orange glow for increased EXP.$NL;$NL;» CONTRACT BROKER$NL;Once you get some cash together and start to level up, you can visit the contract broker and pick which jobs you want to do. Again, if this is your first time, just run with the offered contracts for now.$NL;$NL;TL;DR:$NL;Use Crime.net to find jobs and make money for that epic PAYDAY.$NL;$NL;This is all you need to know for now. Once you've climbed a few rungs on the criminal ladder, I'll drop you another note and talk you through some of the more complex stuff. Good luck.$NL;$NL;- Bain$NL;

Congratulations; You have taken your first step into a larger world.$NL;$NL;Let's have a look at the basic functions of Crime.net. Don't worry if it seems complex at first, everything is more or less self-explanatory.$NL;$NL;» CRIME.NET$NL;This is where you find new jobs, hook up with other crews, learn more about your contacts, and, occasionally, gamble away some of your hard earned off-shore funds.$NL;$NL;» HOSTING A CONTRACT$NL;Jobs with a timer are for you to host. Once the timer reaches zero, that contract will disappear and Crime.net will spawn another. A note on hosting: you are in charge of the contract, and you are responsible for your crew. $NL;$NL;If you drop out, the whole crew loses. Try and keep everyone alive, and make sure everyone makes it to the PAYDAY.$NL;$NL;» JOINING A CONTRACT$NL;Jobs that someone else is hosting have an icon with four men on them instead of a timer. The host's name is diplayed in blue, or green if it's a friend. You can join the crew as long as there is at least one empty slot.$NL;$NL;» DIFFICULTY$NL;Difficulty is rated from zero to four skulls. The more skulls, the harder it is. If this is your first time, pick a no-skull job. Trust me. Four skulls is what we call a Death Wish, and you shouldn't even attempt this until you are at least level 50.$NL;$NL;» REWARDS$NL;Successfully completing a contract will earn you cash and experience. Roll over a contract marker to see what the base payout is. Your final payday may be a lot bigger though; there are bonuses for risk, and you may be able to score additional funds during the heist. Remember: anything you can get your hands on is profit.$NL;$NL;The money and EXP is awarded after each day of the contract is completed. $NL;$NL;Once you've completed the entire contract, you'll also get what we call a PAYDAY: you get to draw a card to unlock a random item. This is how you score rare masks, weapon mods and other useful things. $NL;$NL;» CONTRACT LENGTH$NL;Jobs have different length. Start out doing a few 1 one day jobs before you move on to the longer heists. The EXP reward scales to your level, so there's no reason to kill yourself on a job that's too big for you at the start.$NL;$NL;$NL;THE SLIGHTLY MORE COMPLEX STUFF$NL;$NL;» FILTERS$NL;There are several filters available to tweak what Crime.net displays. Examples: Look for friends only, widen your search, look for a particular job. Hopefully self-explanatory.$NL;$NL;» STEALTH$NL;If you see a small ghost icon next to a contract marker, that means it's possible to complete the job without raising the alarm. Doing a job in stealth will net you an EXP bonus, which applies to any contract you take on immediately afterwards. A word of advice: If you're new to this, don't worry about stealth just yet. It  takes a tight crew with some serious skills to pull off a clean stealth job.$NL;$NL;» THE BOOST SYSTEM$NL;If you do the same job repeatedly, the EXP return will start to drop on that particular contract, and it will be boosted on others. The trick of maximising your EXP is to do a wide range of jobs. Boost is displayed with minus signs and a red glow for reduced EXP; and plus signs and an orange glow for increased EXP.$NL;$NL;» CONTRACT BROKER$NL;Once you get some cash together and start to level up, you can visit the contract broker and pick which jobs you want to do. Again, if this is your first time, just run with the offered contracts for now.$NL;$NL;TL;DR:$NL;Use Crime.net to find jobs and make money for that epic PAYDAY.$NL;$NL;This is all you need to know for now. Once you've climbed a few rungs on the criminal ladder, I'll drop you another note and talk you through some of the more complex stuff. Good luck.$NL;$NL;- Bain$NL;
